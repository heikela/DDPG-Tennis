    "### 4. Learning to act in the reacher environment with DDPG and Population Based Training\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the [Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) (Lillicrap et al, 2016) to attempt to learn to act in the environment described in the `README.md`. The algorithm is the same as used in a previous project in the Reacher environment, but it's application to a two agent system includes additional choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DDPG algorithm is an actor critic algorithm for updating an actor-network (an artificial neural network that implements the deterministic policy function \\mu(s) - attempting to approximate the optimal policy), based on a deterministic policy gradient derived from the critic network's evaluation of the actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way of using a critic that approximates the action value function Q(s,a) to provide a policy gradient for a parameterised policy was derived in the [Deterministic Policy Gradient](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/silver14.pdf) paper (Silver et al, 2014). DDPG improves the performance of the earlier algorithm by using an experience replay buffer and by using separate target networks both for the critic and the actor to stabilise learning. The target networks are continuously updated based on the live networks via a soft-update process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pseudocode for the whole algorithm is shown below (excerpt from [Lillicrap et al, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971)).\n",

    "\n",
    "DDPG as described in the paper is a single agent reinforcement learning algorithm. Here we have a cooperative two-agent environment. We take the approach of treating each agent independently. Additionally, we use a different agent with different weights for each of the two agents playing the game, as opposed to having a single agent model play against itself. The first choice means that the environment is not stationary from the point of view of an individual agent - the learning done by the other agent changes the dynamics of the environment continuously. The fact that the other agent is a genuinely separate agent makes this issue more obvious. This has the potential of making training an agent very unstable, and methods to mitigate this have been proposed, e.g. to use a centralized critic that is aware of the actions of all agents in the environment ([Lowe et al 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02275)). Here we instead use plain DDPG, but use it in the context of Population Based Training of Neural Networks ([Jaderberg et al, 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09846)), hoping that using a population is enough to stabilise the training process.\n",
